IMASPy Manual
=============

IMASPy is a pure-python library to handle arbitrarily nested
data structures. IMASPy is designed for, but not necessarily bound to,
interacting with Interface Data Structures (IDSs) as defined by the
Integrated Modelling & Analysis Suite (IMAS) Data Model.

It provides:

- An easy-to-install and easy-to-get started package by
  * Not requiring an IMAS installation
  * Not strictly requiring matching a Data Dictionary (DD) version
- A pythonic alternative to the IMAS Python High Level Interface (HLI)
- Checking of correctness at assign time, instead of at database write time
- Dynamically created in-memory pre-filled data trees from DD XML specifications

The README is best read on :src:`#imaspy`.
